# Building a Multi-Threaded Browser-based Client around Webrtc
Or, a series of unfortunate events.

I've been working on this project for some time now so we'll be jumping right
into the middle of what's going on. Sometime, in the future, I'll add more
context to what I've been working on.

The premise here is as stated in the title, however.

Currently, after some spelunking (again, the context, which I have not yet
provided), I've come across `mediasoup` as a the primarly library that I will 
be leveraging, both client-side and server-side, for managing Data, Audio, and
Video streams.

This is because, the application that I am building, revolves around real-time
communication, in multiple regards. How, you'll have to see for yourself, when
the application is live.
