# Tru-Breed

I joined Tru-Breed as a founder. As is the case with most early-stage startups,
my role was multi-faceted. I was to develop and deploy strategies encompassing 
the product and its tangentially-pivotal areas. I was charged with building
the product and doing whatever was necessary to encourage its adoption.


Up until this point, Tru-Breed had been a research project. The
takeholders had not defined or aligned on a vision, mission, or purpose. Without 
this established it would be difficult to create a set of baseline hypotheses 
about the various aspects of building Tru-Breed. This meant that not only was 
there a lack of a roadmap for what needed to be accomplished in order to achieve 
success, but also no definition of success.
