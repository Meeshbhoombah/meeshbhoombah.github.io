## My Personal Website
Over the past five years I've undertaken a site redesign four times. The process
is simple, really. I start by laying out a framework for what I wish to 
accomplish with the version of the portfolio I am attempting to build. These
general revolve around myself - generally to either present myself in a specefic
mannor or to present a specefic part of myself in a specefic mannor. I may 
narrow in on an individual  skill or just present projects (both of which I 
consider an extension of my identity)
